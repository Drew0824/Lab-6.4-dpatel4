# Carpet Discounts

A store sells carpets for $2.75 per meter. If a customer buys more than 10m of carpet, they get a discount of 15% on every additional meter of carpet they purchase. 

Write a program that inputs the carpet length that a user wishes to buy, stores the value in a double variable, and then calculates and outputs the total cost of the carpet. Use an if statement to implement the 15% discount.
